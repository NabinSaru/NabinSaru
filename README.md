### Hey there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> 
I'm **Nabin Saru(Jenex)**, a web developer with a penchant for crafting seamless digital experiences and indie game developer. My coding journey spans AngularJS, Vue.js, Vanilla JS, Node Js, Ruby on Rails, Python, and C# and Godot, turning intricate ideas into elegant code.

ðŸŽ® Beyond the pixels, I'm an indie game enthusiast who revels in RPG worlds and hunts for gems in the gaming cosmos. When I'm not coding, I'm exploring hiking trails, drawing inspiration from the great outdoors.

ðŸ“š A book lover at heart, you'll often find me engrossed in tales that transport me to different dimensions. And when the world inside my head demands to be shared, I take up the pen as an avid writer.

ðŸŽ¨ In the realm of creativity, I sketch, delve into digital art, and craft pixel wonders. With Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, I paint my visions into reality.

ðŸŒŸ Join me on this exhilarating journey of coding, creating, adventuring, and storytelling. Let's build, design, explore, read, write, and innovate together!
